# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST - CNN Project)

## 📖 Overview
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**.  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize digits (0-9) from the **MNIST dataset** with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Handwritten text varies widely. AI can help read such inputs, which is useful in **education tech** and **automated exam tools**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Train a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.  
- Achieve **98%+ accuracy** on the MNIST dataset.  
- Optionally, extend with a UI for drawing digits and predicting them.
